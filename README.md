### Glad to see you! üëã Welcome to my (Minqi, Ê±üÊïèÁ•∫ for Chinese) profile:
I'm a third-year PhD candidate in Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). At SUFE, I work with my PhD tutor [Songqiao Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C73EXPMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am glad to be a member of SUFE AI Lab (lead by professor [Hailiang Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kCtylwwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)).
Currently, **Anomaly Detection** (aka Outlier Detection) is my major research direction, and I'm also interested in **NLP** and **Quantitative Investment**, see as follows:

#### Anomaly Detection
